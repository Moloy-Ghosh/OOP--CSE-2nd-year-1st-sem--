A class — in the context of Java — is a template used to create 
objects and to define object data types and methods.

A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class.
Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. The state of an
object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions)
display the object's behavior.
