1. A vector can be declared without specifying any size
explicitly. A vector without size can accommodate an
unknown number of items. Even, when a size is specified,
this can be overlooked and a different number of items
may be put into the vector. Remember, in contrast, an array
must always have its size specified.

2. It is convenient to use vectors to store objects.

3. A vector can be used to store a list of objects that
may vary in size.

4. We can add and delete objects from the list as and when
required.

Vector feature can also be achieved in java through the use
of the Vector class contained in the java.util.package. This
class can be used to create a generic dynamic array known as
vector that can hold objects of any type and any number. The 
objects do not have to be homogeneous. Array can be easily 
implemented as vectors.
