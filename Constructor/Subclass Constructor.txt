A subclass constructor is used to construct the instance
variables of both the subclass and the superclass. The
subclass constructor uses the keyword super to invoke the
constructor method of the superclass. The keyword super
is used subject to the following conditions:
1. super may only be used within a subclass constructor
method.
2. The call to superclass constructor must appear as the
first statement within the subclass constructor.
3. The parameters in the super call must match the order
and type of the instance variable declared in the superclass.
