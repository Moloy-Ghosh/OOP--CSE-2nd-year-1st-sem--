All syntex errors will be detected and displayed by the
java compiler and therefore these errors are known as 
compile-time errors. Whenever the compiler displays an error,
it will not create the class file.

Run-Time Errors:
Sometimes, a program may compile successfully creating 
the class file but may not run properly. Such programs 
may produce wrong result due to wrong logic or may terminate
due to errors such as stack overfllow. Most common run-time
errors are:
-Dividing an integer by zero
-out of the bounds of an array
-
-
-
 
Exceptions:
An exception is a condition that is caused by a run-time error 
in the program. When the java interpreter encounters an error
such as dividing an integer by zero, it creates an exception
object and throws it. If the exception object is not caught 
and handled properly, the interpreter will display an error
message.

Exception in java can be catagorized into two types:
1. Checked Exceptions: These exceptions are explicity handled
in the code itself with the help of try-catch block. Checked
exceptions extended from the java.lang.Exception class.
2. Unchecked exceptions: These exceptions are not essentially
handled in the program code; instead the JVM handles such 
exceptions. Unchecked exceptions are extended from the 
java.lang.RuntimeException class.
