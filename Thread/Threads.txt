(All main programs in our earlier examples can
be called single-threaded programs. Every program
will have at last one thread.)

Threads in java are subprograms of a main application
program and share the same memory space, they are 
known as lightweight threads or lightweight processes.
'Threads running in parallel' does not really mean
that they actually run at the same time.Since all the
threads are running on a single processor, the flow 
of execution is shared between the threads.
Multithreading is a powerful programming tool that
makes java distinctly different from its fellow
programming languages. Multithreading is useful in a
number of ways. It enabes programmers to do multiple 
things at one time. They can divide a long program
(containing operations that are conceptually 
concurrent) into threads and execute them in parallel.
For example, we can send tasks such as printing into 
the background and continue to perform some other task
in the foreground.
