<p> This is a billing system app. The idea for this project came entirely from me. I userd Google to find some methods and understand it that would make it useful.</p>
<p> To run this app on your computer on NetBeans take "BillingSystem" folder from here and keep it in your computer's "NetBeansProjects" folder.</p>
<br>
<p>First page: where you have to give username and password. (Thugh you can give anything in the field! and click log in to go to next paga.)</P>

<p>Second page: Fill up everything and click Submit to go to next page and you can reset this UI clicking reset button.</p>

<p>Third page: You will see details of the product and customer. Click exit to close the app, click go back to go to the second page and if you want to print (though this buttion doesn't work) click print.</p>
