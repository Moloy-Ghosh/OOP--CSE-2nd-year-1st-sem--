<p>This is a word guessing game I developed.  I wrote the code myself. Although I received some guidance from online resources to know some java swing method like how can pass data from one UI to another UI.</p>
<p> To run this app on your computer on NetBeans take "BillingSystem" folder from here and keep it in your computer's "NetBeansProjects" folder.</p>
<br>
<p>First UI: This is a welcome page. Write your name and click "Play game"</P>

<br>
<p>Second UI: Your will see some buttons are disabled, and you can also see your name.</P>

<p>Second UI: After clicking "Start" you will this. You have to guess the word and you have to write it and next you have to click "Next"</P>

<p>Second UI: After clicking "Next" you will see your previous guessing was correct or worng. See this screenshot... it was "correct"! </P>

<p>Second UI: Oh! But this was wrong!</P>

<p>Second UI: And after 10 words, you will see that "Next" button is disabled but other two buttons are enabled. You can play again clicking "Start again" button. But to get result...</P>

<br>
<p>Third UI: If you click "Get final result" from second UI you will get this, where you can see your result! </P>
